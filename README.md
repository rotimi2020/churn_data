# Customer churn prediction: Telecom Churn Dataset

Customer churn, also known as customer retention, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.....
